                    <b>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela</b>(July 18, 1918 - December 5, 2013) in a town called Umtata in the
                    Transkei area of South Africa. Mandela grew up as any other young, South African black boy in an
                    environment of poverty and oppression. As a young man he witnessed the white South African
                    government imposing more and more restrictions on an already down trodden, uneducated, black
                    majority. During his years at the University College of Fort Hare and the University of South
                    Africa, where he studied law, he became even more aware of the atrocities and injustices committed
                    in the name of apartheid. In 1944, Mandela joined the National African Congress (ANC) and became an
                    outspoken, activist against the laws of apartheid. "Dangers and difficulties have not deterred us in
                    the past, they will not frighten us now.

                        A strong-willed man wakes up to the now familiar smell of his jail cell. As his feet touch the
                        cold cement, he realizes he may be here for the rest of his life, but he reassures himself, “It
                        always seems impossible until it’s done”("Nelson Mandela Quotes"). Who would think that this
                        aged, grey haired man, jailed for twenty seven years, would one day walk free and unite the
                        country of South Africa.

                        Courage has many forms, and Mandela demonstrated physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional
                        courage throughout his hard life.

                        As the grey-haired, dignified man finally stepped out of his cell to freedom, his own words,
                        spoken twenty seven-years earlier, reverberated through his mind.

                        Mandela personifies the way in which the human spirit can triumph over hate and evil by
                        embracing peace and reconciliation, in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

                    <li>
                        Mandela's charismatic speeches triggered an investigation by the ruling National Party
                        Government, and in 1962 they arrested and charged Mandela with treason.
